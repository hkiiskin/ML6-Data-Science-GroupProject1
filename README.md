# ML6-Data-Science-GroupProject1, Energy consumtion

## Dataset
Nuuka open API, which provides energy consumption information for the City of Helsinkiâ€™s service properties, is a channel through which the user can search for information about properties owned by the City of Helsinki and their energy consumption.

As the latest Data is more accurate, we used data of year 2022.

We selected six different type of buildings and their electricity use:
- School
- Health Caring Center
- Library
- Dockyard
- Museum
- Office building

## Purpose of the project
- Compare the electricity consumption between the buildings, find the exceptions in the consumption data and evaluate these further.
- Excute several statitical tests, compare electricity consumtion between buildings and in different seasons.
